# 推荐系统相关论文汇总
([English Version is Here](/README_EN.md))
## 介绍
1. 截至2022-11-25，本仓库收集汇总了推荐系统领域相关论文共**486**篇，涉及：**召回**，**粗排**，**精排**，**重排**，**多任务**，**多场景**，**多模态**，**冷启动**，**校准**，
**纠偏**，**多样性**，**公平性**，**反馈延迟**，**蒸馏**，**对比学习**，**因果推断**，**Look-Alike**，**Learning-to-Rank**，**强化学习**等领域，本仓库会跟踪业界进展，持续更新。
2. 因文件名特殊字符的限制，故论文title中所有的`:`都改为了`-`，检索时请注意。
3. 文件名前缀中带有`[]`的，表明本人已经通读过，第一个`[]`中为论文年份，第二个`[]`中为发表机构或公司(可选)，第三个`[]`中为论文提出的model或method的简称(可选)。
4. 在某些一级分类下面，还有若干二级分类；一篇论文可能应该涉及多个二级分类(例如用对比学习的方法做召回)，最终我会将论文放在较主要的那一类下；分类也会随时调整优化，欢迎在`issue`中提出宝贵意见。    
5. 若您是文章作者，且不希望您的论文出现在这里，请在`issue`中提出，我核实后会马上下架。
6. 关于排序算法的一些实现，请见我的另一个repo: https://github.com/tangxyw/RecAlgorithm    
7. 本仓库仅供交流学习使用，不做任何商业目的。
