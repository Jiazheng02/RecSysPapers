# Summary of Papers Related to Recommendation System
## Introduce
1. Up to 2023-06-16, **681** papers related to recommendation system have been collected and summarized in this repo, 
including: **Match**, **Pre-Rank**, **Rank**, **Re-Rank**, **Multi-Task**, **Multi-Scenario**, **Multi-Modal**, **Cold-Start**, **Calibration**, 
**Debias**, **Diversity**, **Fairness**, **Feedback-Delay**, **Distillation**, **Contrastive Learning**, **Casual Inference**, 
**Look-Alike**, **Learning-to-Rank**, **Reinforcement Learning** and other fields, the repo will track the industry progress and update continuely.
2. Due to the restriction of special characters in the file name, all `:` in the title of the paper are changed to `-`. 
Bring to attention please when searching.
3. If the prefix of the file name contains `[]`, it indicates that I have read it thoroughly. The first `[]` refers to 
the publication year of the paper, the second `[]` refers to the institution or company (optional), and the third `[]` 
refers to the abbreviation of the model or the method proposed in the paper (optional).
4. Below some of the primary categories, there are several secondary categories; 
A paper may involve multiple secondary categories (e.g., Match by Contrastive Learning), and eventually I will put the paper in the main category. 
The classification will be adjusted and optimized at any time, welcome to put forward any opinions in the issue.
5. If you are the author of the article and do not want your paper to exhibit here, please mention it in the issue. 
I will remove it immediately after verification.
6. About some Rank Algorithm implementation, please see another repo of mine: https://github.com/tangxyw/RecAlgorithm.
7. This repo is for exchange and study only, without any commercial purpose.
